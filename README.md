# Algorithm Tutor

This is a Python program that uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying information about different sorting algorithms. The program includes a dropdown menu that allows the user to select a specific algorithm, and a text box that displays an explanation of the selected algorithm, along with its time complexity and best/worst case scenarios.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to run this program on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
You will need to have Python and Tkinter library installed on your machine in order to run this program.

Running the program
Download the program and save it on your local machine
Open the command line/terminal and navigate to the directory where the program is saved
Run the command python main.py
The program should open a GUI window containing a dropdown menu and text box.
Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu, and click the 'select' button.
The text box will display an explanation of the selected algorithm, along with its time complexity and best/worst case scenarios.
### Built With
